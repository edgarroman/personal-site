### Helping the community

As part of being an active community member, I am occasionally
called upon to help neighborhood organizations because of my
technology background. I've done a lot of things in the
technology space and there is even more that I have _not_ done,
but as a professional, I'm happy to assist.

I'm fortunate to be significantly involved with my church, my kid's school PTA, and
a local soccer travel club. With each of these nonprofit organizations,
my role primarily is focused on aspects of Information Technology.
I serve this role because I am comfortable in the space, and hope to avoid
selling wrapping paper from door-to-door.

I'm also fortunate because these disparate nonprofits
are a good representative sample of nonprofit diversity. One
has considerable budget and paid staff. Another is entirely volunteers,
and has a moderate budget. And finally the other has a tight budget,
paid staff, and the board is entirely volunteers.
So while the missions of all are quite different, the technology
needs are surprisingly overlapping.

### Can you be our 'Webmaster?'

The dreaded question that most folks with technology background is:
'Can you be our Webmaster?' This is question is asked because
websites are generally the most high-profile online presence of
most nonprofits. To the lay person, the mystery of being a
'Webmaster' is many-fold; they have no idea what to do or
where to start when creating or maintaining a website.

Enough Internet lore has focused on this term to mean the final
owner and arbiter of everything online.
In the bad old days, creating a website was either an arduous or
expensive proposition. But now with services like Wix, SquareSpace,
and others, it's quite approachable -- yet still mysterious.

So when the President of the Board asks you to be the Webmaster,
he really means: can you create/manage the website, all content on the
site, coordinate the social media footprint, write and send
newsletters,
handle associated video / audio vendors, own the G Suite administrator
role for
email and document sharing, facilitate paypal fundraisers,
and finally: be the purchasing
agent for Office 365.

And that's if you're dealing with a small nonprofit. Inevitably
each nonprofit will then have specialized services like donor management,
e-commerce sites, and program registration.

Oh by the way, you're also on the hook for Information Security
policies and principles. So keep patching your Wordpress site or risk
becoming a hacked pirate warez site (or worse).

### IT is more than just a website

To geek out just a bit, I'd like to highlight a number of technology areas that many
nonprofits must deal with. Feel free to skip to the next section if not interested.

The foundations:

-   Domain name registration and ongoing renewals
-   DNS hosting and configuration
-   Website and web hosting regardless of service
-   Email Administration (at the time of this writing,
    often Google's G Suite which includes GMail and Google Docs)

The money collection:

-   Payment sites (e-commerce, paypal, stripe, etc)
-   Payment Gateways (credit card processing, ACH)
-   Program registration / Event registration
-   Special events: Auction, Fun Runs, Trivia Nights

The communications:

-   Newsletter / Email administration (MailChimp, Constant Contact)
-   Customer Relationship Managers (Salesforce, etc)
-   Video conferencing (zoom, gotomeeting, voip lines and voicemail)
-   Helpdesk for members

The Social Medias (and creating content for each):

-   Facebook
-   Instagram
-   Twitter
-   And others that are new as soon as I published this article

The Information Security aspect

-   Setting up / Disabling Volunteer accounts (surely no one shares credentials, right?)
-   Resetting forgotten email passwords
-   Password management (avoiding weak passwords, and changing them on a periodic basis)

Add on to this list the ability to effectively negotiate with technology vendors to ensure
high value investment of dollars, and this is a pretty big list.

### So what's a technologist to do?

Tough situation. And in some nonprofit organizations, there is no centralized
person managing the IT footprint and various committee members merely
sign-up to the latest SaaS-du-jour to run surveys, sell tickets,
run auctions. Total chaos and confusion from the members and a nightmare for
budget management.

### Introduce an IT position

It is very common to look at the organizational structure of a nonprofit and
see a treasurer role, maybe even a comptroller role. Enough shenanigans have
happened where nefarious board members embezzle money for their own profit and
seriously impact the organizations, that it's very common to have dedicated
board members or committees dedicated to managing money. This makes a lot of
sense: money management without strong controls tempts many a volunteer.

I do not know of a technologist using nonprofit resources
for personal gain - the link to direct profit is more tenuous.  
I will posit the dependency upon technology and technology services is for a nonprofit is
so important that, just like income and expenses, a nonprofit cannot effectively
function without technology.

So why do so many community based nonprofit organizations not have a 'Director of Information
Technology' board position? Effectively, this person would be the Chief Technology
Officer if this were a for-profit company.

> I would encourage all community nonprofit organizations to create a 'Director of IT' volunteer or board position

If such a position exists, it would raise the level of awareness that if IT gets screwed up, then
everyone in the organization will be less effective or blocked entirely from accomplishing
the mission.

Additionally, it serves as a single point of contact for other volunteers or committees to
coordinate ad-hoc or one-time needs such as surveys, or other temporary technology needs.

It allows the Director of IT to establish balanced policies for Information Security and
protect the organization from malicious online threats.

### Build in Term Limits

Finally, from personal experience, it is important to recognize that volunteers will come
and go. This is the same for the President and the Director of IT. If the Director of IT
position is not recognized, then too often the organization assumes that one person
can keep doing the job indefinitely. Especially if the person doing the job is introverted,
unwilling to complain about the excessive load, and suffers burnout silently.

Thus, once the position is established, I recommend a default term with options for
serving multiple terms. But please establish a term limit. Not only do people get sick
of managing a website for eight years, but usually websites need significant rework
after 3 or 4 years.

Introducing new talent and energy into this role is as critical as ensuring you don't keep
the treasurer or president around longer than needed.

### Going forward

I hope more community nonprofits take this advice to heart. Not only will their technology-savvy
members appreciate the interesting opportunities, but also the recognition of effort.

And hopefully allow the organization to accelerate the fundamental mission.
