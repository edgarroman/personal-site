This appeared in a monthly newsletter I receive. I thought it was quite an apt description
of adolescence.

> Spring is such a haphazard season as it
> sputters and catches with starts and
> stops until it finally finds its way. On the
> days that promise summer, the students
> are in the courtyard having lunch and in
> the parking lots sharing fellowship; on
> days that remind us of winter, they huddle around tables in the cafeteria, shoulders drawn in, hunched over books and
> phones. Adolescence seems to me the
> springtime of life. On many days I see in
> our young men the promise of adulthood. They carry themselves with maturity, demonstrate a commitment to
> community, think deeply, prepare appropriately, and live out a kind of independence that takes
> responsibility for its actions. There are winter days in adolescence , too. Days of hunkered down,
> bunker-mentality thinking and acting
> where everything is someone elseâ€™s fault,
> the world has conspired against them
> and the nights are longer then the day.
> But then, spring comes back.
